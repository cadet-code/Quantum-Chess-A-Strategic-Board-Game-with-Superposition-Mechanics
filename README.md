📌 Project Overview
🎮 Project Topic:
Quantum Chess is an experimental board game that brings principles of quantum mechanics into the world of classical chess. By introducing superposition, probabilistic moves, and entanglement, this game adds layers of unpredictability and depth to traditional strategy.

🎯 Objective:
The aim is to develop a strategic AI capable of playing Quantum Chess using advanced algorithms like Minimax (with probabilistic modifications) and Alpha-Beta Pruning, further supported by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for handling quantum uncertainties. Optional integration of Reinforcement Learning is also planned to enhance decision-making through self-play.

📖 Game Description
♟️ Original Game Background:
Chess is a classic two-player board game played on an 8×8 grid, where each player controls 16 pieces with the objective of checkmating the opponent’s king.

✨ Innovations Introduced:
Superposition Mechanics: Pieces can exist in multiple positions simultaneously, resolved upon observation.

Quantum Moves: Moves are probabilistic rather than deterministic, adding strategic uncertainty.

Entanglement: Certain pieces are linked, so moving one impacts the other.

Modified Board: A 10×10 board with two new, custom pieces to deepen strategic possibilities.

🧠 AI Approach and Methodology
🛠️ AI Techniques:
Minimax Algorithm: Adapted for multi-state, probabilistic decision-making.

Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimizes decision trees and reduces unnecessary calculations.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): Addresses uncertainty in outcomes and move evaluations.

Reinforcement Learning (Optional): For enhancing AI strategy via self-play.

📊 Heuristic Design:
Considers material value, positional advantages, and superposition strength.

Includes risk assessments for entangled pieces and probabilistic moves.

📈 Complexity Analysis:
Traditional chess has a branching factor of ~35.

Quantum Chess increases this drastically due to superposition and entanglement complexities.

Challenges include managing superposition collapses and entanglement effects within reasonable computational limits.

📋 Game Rules and Mechanics
📜 Modified Rules:
Pieces can occupy multiple squares simultaneously until observed.

Special Quantum Capture rules when targeting superpositioned pieces.

Two new pieces with unique abilities added to the 10×10 board.

🏁 Winning Conditions:
Traditional checkmate still applies.

New strategic considerations from quantum mechanics enhance gameplay.

🔄 Turn Sequence:
Each player performs a classical or quantum move.

Optionally, an Observation Phase can be triggered to resolve piece states.
